**Auto hot key Macro script to control audio devices and media**    <br />
  <br />
right ctrl + / = media pause  <br />
right ctrl + . = media next  <br />
right ctrl + , = media prev  <br />
right ctrl + up = volume increase (by 2) <br />
right ctrl + down = volume decrease (by 2) <br />
ctrl + alt + z = next audio device   <br />
<br />
also have binding for win key stuff for my model m   <br />
alt + space = win key    <br />
ctrl + alt + L = logout    <br />
ctrl + alt + arrow = move window (still janky)    <br />
----(need to rerun script to detect newly plugged audio devices)  <br />
<br />
I recommend compiling this into an exe binary with ahk and throwing it in win startup dir  <br />

*Script needs to be run with admin privs*   <br />
