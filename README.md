*Auto hot key Macro script to control audio devices and media*    <br />
**Script needs to be run with admin privs**   <br />
  <br />
right ctrl + / = media pause  <br />
right ctrl + . = media next  <br />
right ctrl + , = media prev  <br />
right ctrl + up = volume increase (by 2) <br />
right ctrl + down = volume decrease (by 2) <br />
win + z = next audio device   <br />
----(need to rerun script to detect newly plugged audio devices)  <br />
<br />
I recommend compiling this into an exe binary with ahk and throwing it in win startup dir
